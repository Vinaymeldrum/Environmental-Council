        <p>
          Climate change is a significant change in long-term weather patterns<sup>1</sup>. This could be a change in the average precipitation of a region, or a change in the average temperature<sup>2</sup>. Global warming is a measure of climate change and represents an
          increase in average global temperature<sup>3</sup>. There are many impacts of climate change, ranging from rising sea levels and melting glaciers to floods, droughts and heat waves.
        </p>
        <p>
          The average temperature of the planet's surface has increased by about 1.1°C since the end of the 19th century due to human emissions into the atmosphere<sup>4</sup>. Greenland lost around 150 to 250 km<sup>3</sup> of ice between 2002 and 2006, and Antarctica
          lost about 152 km<sup>3</sup> of ice between 2002 and 2005<sup>5</sup>. Average temperatures in the Arctic have increased by about 5°C over the past 100 years<sup>6</sup>. Recent data shows that there will be almost no ice remaining in the Arctic in the coming decades<sup>7</sup>. The
          sea level has increased about 8 inches over the last century<sup>8</sup>. Several large cities in the world would be flooded because of rising sea levels, so many people would be displaced<sup>9</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Climate change can cause extreme weather conditions such as floods, tornadoes, lightning, hurricanes, droughts, heat waves, heavy rainfall, and snowstorms. In the future, if we do not slow down climate change, hurricanes will become
          stronger and more intense and sea levels will increase by 1 to 4 feet by 2100, which will increase flooding in many areas<sup>10</sup>. Higher temperatures lead to droughts. Decreasing rainfall can cause droughts or turn a region into a desert<sup>11</sup>. When
          the soil becomes dry, the sun's heat will warm the soil and air as there is no moisture to evaporate, resulting in warmer and drier conditions<sup>12</sup>. This can cause famines because agriculture is impossible. Droughts or desertification can
          affect drinking water levels in underground reservoirs around the world. About half of the world's countries could be short of water by 2025, and almost 75% of the world's population by 2050<sup>13</sup>. Climate change threatens our health due to
          increased disease, lack of clean water, smog and more<sup>14</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Melting ice caps and glaciers are destroying Arctic ecosystems. Melting ice is increasing sea levels and destroying the habitat of northern animals such as polar bears. Many polar bears are starving or drowning due to melting glaciers<sup>15</sup>.
          Ocean acidity has increased by 30% as the oceans absorb about 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year for the last 200 years<sup>16</sup>. Coral reefs in waters with a high concentration of carbon dioxide become less stable and solid, causing
          bleaching and eventual death of the coral<sup>17</sup>. By 2050, only 5% of the Great Barrier Reef will survive<sup>18</sup>. About half a billion people depend on coral reef fish as their main source of food<sup>19</sup>. Global warming causes hot, dry climates, which
          facilitate forest fires and destroy ecosystems and habitats for countless species<sup>20</sup>. Global warming will become the biggest cause of species extinctions this century. A temperature rise of 1.5°C can put 20 to 30% of species at risk of
          extinction<sup>21</sup>.
